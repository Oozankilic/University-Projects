The code is tested with itself from two different devices one is ubuntu and the other is macOS.
In the program ip address of the device and the subnet address is learned with ipconfig getifaddr 
en0 request which is not used in the ubuntu devices. So the ip address and subnet address may need 
to be added manually if the working device is not compatible.  

program runs as 'python3 zeroConf.py'
